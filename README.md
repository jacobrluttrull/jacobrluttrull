# Hi, I'm Jacob Luttrull

**Email:** jacobluttrull2@gmail.com  
**Location:** Montpelier, Ohio, United States  

I'm a computer science graduate and backend-focused programmer actively strengthening my skills through consistent, hands-on project work. I have completed the **Scientific Computing with Python** certification through freeCodeCamp and continue expanding my technical knowledge through real-world application.

This GitHub showcases recent and ongoing projects that reflect my focus on backend systems, problem-solving, and practical software design.
