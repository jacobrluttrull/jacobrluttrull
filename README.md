 **Location:**  Montpelier Ohio, United States  

I'm a 22-year-old programmer trying to improve my programming skills through consistent work and dedication to be better every day. I just completed the Scientific Computing in Python course from FreeCodeCamp with all the code for every project and exercise in a pinned repo. I will going through the ML Engineer Track on DataCamp and working through the Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensflow book by Geron. I will have dedicated repos for those as well. 
Please and go check my diabetic capstone project as it shows my best work to date.
